This is a simple implementation of the classic hangman game in Python. The game randomly chooses a word from a predefined list of words, and the player must guess the word by suggesting letters.

## Usage
The game will prompt you to enter a single letter to guess the word. You will have 5 lives, and each incorrect guess will result in the loss of a life. You win the game by correctly guessing the word before running out of lives.
